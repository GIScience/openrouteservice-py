    """Get directions between an origin point and a destination point.

    For more information, visit https://go.openrouteservice.org/documentation/.

    :param coordinates: The coordinates tuple the route should be calculated
        from. In order of visit.
    :type origin: list or tuple of coordinate lists or tuples

    :param profile: Specifies the mode of transport to use when calculating
        directions. One of ["driving-car", "driving-hgv", "foot-walking",
        "foot-hiking", "cycling-regular", "cycling-road","cycling-mountain",
        "cycling-electric",]. Default "driving-car".
    :type mode: string

    :param format: Specifies the response format. One of ['json', 'geojson', 'gpx']. Default "json".
        Geometry format for "json" is Google's encodedpolyline. The GPX schema the response is validated
        against can be found here:
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GIScience/openrouteservice-schema/master/gpx/v1/ors-gpx.xsd.
    :type format: str

    :param format_out: DEPRECATED.
    :type format: str

    :param preference: Specifies the routing preference. One of ["fastest, "shortest",
        "recommended"]. Default "fastest".
    :type preference: string

    :param units: Specifies the distance unit. One of ["m", "km", "mi"]. Default "m".
    :type units: string

    :param language: Language for routing instructions. One of ["en", "de", "cn",
        "es", "ru", "dk", "fr", "it", "nl", "br", "se", "tr", "gr"]. Default "en".
    :type language: string

    :param language: The language in which to return results.
    :type language: string

    :param geometry: Specifies whether geometry should be returned. Default True.
    :type geometry: boolean

    :param geometry_simplify: Specifies whether to simplify the geometry.
        Default False.
    :type geometry_simplify: boolean

    :param instructions: Specifies whether to return turn-by-turn instructions.
        Default True.
    :type instructions: boolean

    :param instructions_format: Specifies the the output format for instructions.
        One of ["text", "html"]. Default "text".
    :type instructions_format: string

    :param roundabout_exits: Provides bearings of the entrance and all passed
        roundabout exits. Adds the 'exit_bearings' array to the 'step' object
        in the response. Default False.
    :type roundabout_exits: boolean

    :param attributes: Returns route attributes on ["detourfactor", "percentage"].
        Must be a list of strings. Default None.
    :type attributes: list or tuple of strings

    :param maneuvers: Specifies whether the maneuver object is included into the step object or not. Default: false.
    :type maneuvers bool

    :param radiuses: A list of maximum distances (measured in
        meters) that limit the search of nearby road segments to every given waypoint.
        The values must be greater than 0, the value of -1 specifies no limit in
        the search. The number of radiuses must correspond to the number of waypoints.
        Default None.
    :type radiuses: list or tuple

    :param bearings: Specifies a list of pairs (bearings and
        deviations) to filter the segments of the road network a waypoint can
        snap to. For example bearings=[[45,10],[120,20]]. Each pair is a
        comma-separated list that can consist of one or two float values, where
        the first value is the bearing and the second one is the allowed deviation
        from the bearing. The bearing can take values between 0 and 360 clockwise
        from true north. If the deviation is not set, then the default value of
        100 degrees is used. The number of pairs must correspond to the number
        of waypoints. Setting optimized=false is mandatory for this feature to
        work for all profiles. The number of bearings corresponds to the length
        of waypoints-1 or waypoints. If the bearing information for the last waypoint
        is given, then this will control the sector from which the destination
        waypoint may be reached.
    :type bearings: list or tuple or lists or tuples

    :param continue_straight: Forces the route to keep going straight at waypoints
        restricting u-turns even if u-turns would be faster. This setting
        will work for all profiles except for driving-*. In this case you will
        have to set optimized=false for it to work. True or False. Default False.
    :type continue_straight: boolean

    :param elevation: Specifies whether to return elevation values for points.
        Default False.
    :type elevation: boolean

    :param extra_info: Returns additional information on ["steepness", "suitability",
        "surface", "waycategory", "waytype", "tollways", "traildifficulty", "roadaccessrestrictions"].
        Must be a list of strings. Default None.
    :type extra_info: list or tuple of strings

    :param suppress_warnings: Tells the system to not return any warning messages and corresponding extra_info.
        For false the extra information can still be explicitly requested by adding it with the extra_info parameter.
    :type suppress_warnings: bool

    :param optimized: If set False, forces to not use Contraction Hierarchies.
    :type optimized: bool

    :param options: Refer to https://go.openrouteservice.org/documentation for
        detailed documentation. Construct your own dict() following the example
        of the minified options object. Will be converted to json automatically.
    :type options: dict

    :param validate: Specifies whether parameters should be validated before sending the request. Default True.
    :type validate: bool
    
    :param dry_run: Print URL and parameters without sending the request.
    :param dry_run: boolean

    :raises ValueError: When parameter has wrong value.
    :raises TypeError: When parameter is of wrong type.

    :returns: sanitized set of parameters
